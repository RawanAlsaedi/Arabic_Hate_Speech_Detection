# Arabic_Hate_Speech_Detection
In this project, we will be exploring the application of the AraBERT model specifically for the task of hate speech detection. We will use the AJGT Sentiment Analysis dataset from K. M. Alomari, H. M. ElSherif, and K. Shaalan, “Arabic tweets sentimental analysis using machine learning,” in Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial, Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems, pp. 602–610, Montreal, Canada, June 2017.
